# Project Studio

Project Studio helps BTech students ship portfolio‑ready projects and profiles before placements.  
Instead of empty or random GitHub repos, you walk into interviews with 1–3 solid projects, a live demo, and a LinkedIn story you can actually talk about.

## What Project Studio does

- Designs and builds realistic full‑stack projects around your background and target roles.
- Sets up a clean GitHub repo with commits, README, and basic project documentation.
- Deploys the project (e.g. Vercel / Render) so you can share a live link.
- Prepares a simple story for interviews: what the project does, how it’s built, and trade‑offs.
- Adds college‑friendly paperwork (SRS, diagrams, PPT, report draft) when required.

The goal is simple: fix the “no good projects / empty GitHub / blank LinkedIn” problem before internship or placement season.

## Who it is for

Project Studio is designed for:

- 3rd year (end) and final‑year BTech students.
- Students who know some coding but never shipped a proper project.
- People switching stacks (e.g. from Java to MERN) who need 1–2 strong repos quickly.
- Teams who want their group project to look professional on GitHub and LinkedIn.

If you already have raw code from college, it can be cleaned up and turned into a presentable repo and portfolio piece.

## How it works

1. You share:
   - GitHub and LinkedIn links (if any).
   - Current semester and placement / viva dates.
   - Any college guidelines or preferred tech stack.

2. A project plan is suggested:
   - 1–2 project ideas that fit your time and level.
   - Which services/add‑ons make sense for you.
   - A clear quote and timeline.

3. Build and hand‑off:
   - Milestone updates while the project is built.
   - Final delivery with code, deployment, docs, and profile copy.
   - Support until viva / review for the agreed scope.
